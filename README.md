## 📌 Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to analyze the sales data of a fictional superstore and extract valuable insights to support business decisions. Key challenges include cleaning and transforming raw datasets, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and delivering intuitive, interactive visualizations.

## ✅ My Approach

This project was independently built as part of my data analytics portfolio. Here's how I tackled it:

- 🔹 **Python** was used to clean and transform the Excel-based sales dataset.
- 🔹 Data was converted into CSV and loaded into a **SQL database**.
- 🔹 **SQL queries** were written to extract patterns, trends, and key metrics.
- 🔹 A polished **Power BI dashboard** was developed to display results across 3 key areas:
  - Sales Performance
  - Customer Analysis
  - Product Profitability

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Features

The final dashboard includes:

- 📅 Slicers by Year and Region (2012–2015, USCA, LATAM, Europe, Asia Pacific, Africa)
- 📦 KPIs: Sales, Quantity, Avg. Delivery Days, Return Orders
- 📍 Map visualization of sales by country
- 🍰 Pie charts and bar charts to analyze:
  - Sales by Segment & Market
  - Top 10 Customers
  - Top 6 Profit Products
  - Top 6 Loss Products

✔️ Includes a **custom blue background** for a modern, professional aesthetic.
